# A Solver for CVRPTW with ORtools Constraint Programming

## main.py
   path_list = ['data/size2000/R_2000.txt']
   time_limit = [600,3600,18000]
   time_precision_scaler = 10
   solve instances in the path_list sequentially with the time_limit.

## checker.py
  check the feasiblility of solution output by solver

## CVRPTW_gen.py
  generate CVRPTW instances.
